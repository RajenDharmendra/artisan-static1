Check List For Stocks

Rajen JangamApril 01, 2019

Why we need Check List?



Let us assume you are driving a car from New York to Los Angeles. 



What all you check to make sure your trip a reasonably safe and comfort trip...



You have some basic check lists ...once you are ready you are good to go...But any thing  happens beyond your control you cant do any thing about that ...



 The same analogy applies for investing as well ...



Let me walk through in History going Backwards on Oct 30 1935..



The US Army Air Corps was conducting a flight competition to build the next-generation long-range bomber. Based on early evaluations, Boeing‚Äôs aluminium alloy model 299 was expected to come out ahead by a distance compared to those of competition. The Model 299 could carry five times as many bombs as the army had requested, could fly twice as further and was faster than any previous bomber. With a wingspan of 103 feet and four engines jutting out from the wings, it was already nicknamed ‚ÄúFlying Fortress‚Äù.





Flying Fortress

The competition was expected to be a formality and the army had already planned to order 65 of the Model 299. A small crowd of top army brass and manufacturing executives watched as the sleek and impressive machine taxied onto the runway, piloted by veteran pilot and the Army corps chief of flight testing, Major Ployer P. Hill.



With the all-clear, the majestic plane roared down the tarmac and climbed sharply to 300 feet. Then it stalled, turned on one wing, and crashed in a fiery explosion. Two of the five crew members, died, including Major Hill. The army declared the smaller Douglas model as winner and Boeing went nearly bankrupt.



Investigation revealed nothing mechanically wrong with the plane. Hill had forgotten to release a new locking mechanism on the elevator and rudder controls. With four engines, each with its own oil-fuel mix, retractable landing gear, wing flaps, electric trim tabs that needed adjustment to maintain different air speeds, constant speed propellers with hydraulic controls, the conclusion was the Model 299 was too complex leading to ineptitude on the part of the pilots. In short, it was ‚Äútoo much plane for one man to fly‚Äù



A lot of what we do today seems like that. Especially in investing. There is a lot of stuff to read and enormous amount of data flowing in to process .....Starting from  balance sheet and other financial statement analyses, there are concepts like value, contrarian, momentum investing, stock buybacks, rights issues, Federal Reserve action and many more..  The list goes on and on



In short, investing seems like too much plane for one man to fly,



The Check List Manifesto...(The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right

By Atul Gawande) recommended book on this topic.

Must Read Book üëâThe Investment Checklist: The Art of In-Depth Research  by Michael Shearn













In spite of its failure at the flight competition, the army purchased a few Model 299s as test planes because some still felt they were flyable. They assigned a group of test pilots to figure out what to do with them. Instead of prescribing longer training for pilots, given the it was hard to imagine having more experience and expertise than Major Hill, they created checklists.



The pilot checklists were simple, brief and to-the-point, short enough to fit on index cards with step-by-step checks for takeoff, flight, landing and taxiing. By putting down the routine things that pilots already knew how to do, like checking that the brakes have been released, doors and windows are secured, pilots went on to fly the Model 299 for 1.8 Million miles without accident.(But recent crashes on flight A737 Max has different reasons)



Think that your own job or investing is too complex to be reduced to checklists? The Model 299 example should certainly make you question that. Over time, with considerable trial and error, I‚Äôve come up with my own ‚Äúinvesting checklist‚Äù that I refer to before any buy decision. Note that this isn‚Äôt meant to cover the entire process of determining allocation to equities down to valuing and selecting a stock. Like ‚Äútakeoff‚Äù or ‚Äúflight‚Äù for pilots, effective checklists target specific activities, and this one tackles one where the abundance of information can lead to basic errors by investors.



This checklist comes into play after you have reason to believe that a company might be a potential investment, be it from the FMCG, from personal experience of using their products, their ‚Äúdominant‚Äù position in their industry or other sources. or a Manufacturing firm which uses its capital smartly to generate enough returns for their stake holders (ie) at least more than the hurdle rate...



Note: Getting a ‚Äúhot tip‚Äù for a ‚Äúcounter‚Äù that has ‚Äúmoved up smartly‚Äù does not count as a basis for a potential investment.

The Check List Approach 



1. Good Business

a. What are the business‚Äôs competitive advantages? (Is it a simple and niche business? Has it maintained market dominance and remained ahead of its competition? Is its market position sustainable? Is it an innovator?)



b. Is the business in a large and high growth sector? Is the company well positioned to capture growth (Maintain and grow market share)? Can the company scale and grow and in what time frame?



c. Does the business generate or have the potential to generate positive and predictable cash flows and superior ROE? How capital intensive is the business (both fixed and working capital)?



d. Is the business at the cusp of a turnaround, where ROEs / other financial metrics are slated to move up in the foreseeable future?  



2. Quality Management

Would you be comfortable doing business with the people running this company? Google the company founder (promoter) and the executive team.



Is the promoter still involved in the running of the company? Has his stake reduced significantly over the recent past?

Have there been recent top management exits? Mentions of accounting irregularities at previous organisations?

Is he typically seen on page 3 getting out of his Bugatti Veyron while the company shows 8 consecutive quarters of losses?(common sense should be applied here)

Does the Promoter Pledged a significant amount of stocks.

3. Not a big borrower

Businesses need outside capital to grow and debt is a viable source of this capital. For companies certain of their long-term performance, debt can be a useful tool to not give away too much of the upside from a well-run business. However, every company is likely to face lean times, a habitual borrower is a higher risk investment because debt-holders have first claim on the company‚Äôs profits and also on its assets.



On the Profit & Loss (P&L) or Income statement, look for the ‚ÄòInterest‚Äô payment and compare it to the Earnings Before Depreciation, Interest and Taxes (EBITDA)

Do interest payments account for a significant (> ~40%) of EBITDA?

4. Good Cash Flows

‚ÄúCash is a fact, profit an opinion‚Äù ‚Äì Alfred Rappaport

The dual-entry accounting system evolved to capture the intricacies of a flourishing business, where sales and expenses don‚Äôt necessarily coincide with exchange of cash and expenses. This was meant to help differentiate actions that had one-time immediate impact versus providing added capability over the long run e.g. Modernizing the assembly line might be a significant one-time cost which will pay for itself over three years because of lower cost of manufacturing. However, this mechanism has also allowed companies to ‚Äútweak‚Äù the picture they present to shareholders. Irrespective of accounting handiwork, following the cash usually provides a good view of the health of the business



On the Cash-Flow statement, look for ‚ÄòCash Flow from Operations‚Äô (CFO) over a minimum five year period and compare against EBITDA on the P&L statement

Does CFO trend similar to and constitute a significant part (~100% aggregated over 5 years) of EBITDA?

5. Dependable Growth Rate

The prospect of future earnings growth plays a large part in determining price of a share and a company that has significant growth prospects is a far more attractive investment than one with the same current earnings but no growth prospects.



Do the key metrics (revenue, EBITDA, Earnings per share, Dividend per share) over time show healthy growth, compared to the market for that business?

Does growth in sales reflect in operating profits and percolate to earnings per share and dividends paid out?

Do growth rates vary greatly from year-to-year or do they stay relatively consistent?

6. Offers (some) yield

Yield in this context is the annual return you get for holding a stock. The primary reason for buying a stock is the expectation that the price will rise substantially over a period of time. However, a company that pays out a consistent dividend on a regular basis, indicates a disciplined and prudent management that works to ensure enough ‚Äúcash earnings‚Äù to pay out to shareholders



Look for Equity Dividend paid out as a percentage of Cash Flow from Operations and Net Profits

Is there a consistent trend of regular dividends that come from cash earnings of the business?

Does the dividend yield amount is at-least 1.5 to 2% of the stock price?





For every company you consider investing in, run through your checklist to ensure you don‚Äôt overlook an obvious weakness because of irrational exuberance. By filtering out companies with obvious weaknesses, you stay focused on the central tenet of identifying ‚Äúquality‚Äù companies only. Every company that ‚Äúpasses‚Äù the checklist won‚Äôt necessarily be a good investment on account of toughening industry conditions, but few companies that  clear the checklist are likely to be good long-term investments.Provided you do Due Diligence.
